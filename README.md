Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Flutter] is an open source framework by Google for building beautiful, natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

- [Supabase] is an open source Firebase alternative.
- [GetX] is an extra-light and powerful solution for Flutter.
- [get_cli] Use this command with care it will overwrite all files in the lib folder. It allows you to choose between two structures, getx_pattern and clean.
